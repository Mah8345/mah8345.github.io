      <h3>embedded tinkerings</h3>
      <p>Actually there isn’t a word “Tinkerings” in English vocabulary, I named the project “Embedded Tinkerings” because I wanted the name to imply what the project is about. The project is a collection of small project each discovering a simple concept of embedded systems universe. This one is not a lecture’s project.</p>
